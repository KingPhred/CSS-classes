            <h2>kingdom of denmark</h2>
            <p class="about-denmark">Denmark (Danish: Danmark, pronounced [ˈtænmɑk] (listen)) is a Nordic country in Northern Europe. It is the most populous and politically central constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark, a constitutionally unitary state that includes the autonomous territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland in the North Atlantic Ocean.European Denmark is the southernmost of the Scandinavian countries, lying southwest of Sweden, south of Norway and north of Germany.</p>

            <p class="about-denmark">Denmark is a small country with a population of approximately 5,8 million. It is one of the three Scandinavian countries, and Denmark also shares border with Germany. In most of Denmark the soil rests on glacially deposited gravel, sand, and clay, under which lie ancient chalk and limestone. The subterranean limestone resulted in a permeation of the soil with calcium, which diminished its value for agriculture when it was first brought under cultivation in the Neolithic Period</p>

            <p class="about-denmark">Denmark is practically an island nation, as it consits of more than 440 islands (but only about 70 of them are inhabited). Even the Danish capital, Copenhagen, is situated on an island. Nowhere in Denmark is more than 50 km for the sea. Denmark’s location makes it a great gateway to other Scandinavian countries and the rest of Europe. Berlin is just an hour’s flight away. London and Paris can be reached in less than two hours. And Barcelona, Rome, Vienna and Prague are alle just a few hours travel away.</p>
